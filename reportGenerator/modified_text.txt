Hey team,

I am a professional web application pentester, having secured more than 75+ websites, and have hunted down vulnerabilities.
I have found a serious web application vulnerability on one of the asset of "makeup.com.ua" .

May i know where should i report my vulnerability finding, to which email address ? according to the bug bounty policy.

If this email is unclear to you, then i would highly recommend this to be forwarded to the Security team of makeup.com.ua , or the CTO of the organization.
