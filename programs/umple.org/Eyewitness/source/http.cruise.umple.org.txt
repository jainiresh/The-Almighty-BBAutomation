<h1>Complexity Reduction in Software Engineering (CRuiSE)</h1>

<p>CRuiSE is the research group of Dr. Timothy C. Lethbridge, in the 
School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of 
Ottawa.</p>

<p>The acronym has "Complexity Reduction" and "Software Engineering" as 
keywords. But the "ui" in the centre is critical: Reducing complexity 
means, to a large extent, keeping the the "user interface" central. 
However, we are not just talking about the interface for the end-user of 
software, we are also talking about the interface for software engineers; 
in particular the programming languages, modelling languages and other 
software engineering tools they use.</p><p>

&nbsp;<br>

</p><h2>Overview of the research</h2>

<p>One of the biggest challenges to software engineering is complexity. 
Software systems are naturally complex due to the tendancy to develop 
large numbers of features (and hence vast volumes of code) to satisfy the 
perceived and real requirements. However, there is a great deal we can do 
to reduce the complexity, and this research group investigates a 
variety of these.</p>

<p>Part of our research is to study what software engineers find complex, 
and why many of them are resistant to techniques such as modelling and 
using software engineering tools that are supposed to simplify 
development. We are studying how to unify the notions of programming amd 
modelling, so software engineers can develop and maintain systems quickly 
and at a high level of abstraction.</p>

<p>One of our ongoing subprojects is to develop a language called 
<a href="http://www.umple.org">Umple</a> 
which is designed to inccorporate modelling concepts such as 
associations, attributes, states and actions into a programming language. 
The developer/programmer would be able to work using any text editor, any 
IDE (such as Eclipse or VS Code) as well as in a web browser. Se or he would be able to specify the above 
high-level constructs as well as lower-level algorithmic code all in a 
textual form. However, the graphical form would not be lost, as visual 
representations (like UML), would still appear.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>The UmpleOnline web interface is at <a href="/umpleonline/">try.umple.org</a></p>
  </li><li><p>The user manual is at <a href="/umple/GettingStarted.html">manual.umple.org</a></p>
  </li><li><p>The Umple home page is at <a href="/umple">www.umple.org</a></p>
  </li><li><p>Umple download page: <a href="/umpleonline/download_eclipse_umple_plugin.shtml">dl.umple.org</a></p>
</li></ul>

&nbsp;<br>

<h2>Some of our hypotheses</h2>

<ul>

<li>There need be no distinction between programming and modelling. 

</li><li>Software engineers are resistant to modelling for some of the 
following reasons:

  <ol>

  <li>Graphical modelling tools are not as fast to use as programming 
tools, largely due to the need to use the mouse to build diagrams. This 
could be potentially overcome if models could be created and edited with 
a text editor, in the same manner as a program is edited.<p>

  </p></li><li>Modelling languages do not allow software engineers to express all 
the ideas they want, or do not make it easy to express ideas as 
programming languages.<p>

  </p></li><li>In general, software engineers are not well trained in modelling 
languages such as UML, so do not know how to take good advantage of 
them.<p>

  </p></li><li>The most powerful tools for modelling tend to be expensive, causing 
resistance to their use, especially among those in smaller companies and 
those developing open-source software on their own. On the other hand, 
the less powerful tools tend to merely allow drawing diagrams, as 
opposed to creating executable systems.<p>

  </p></li></ol>

</li><li>The majority of software engineers using UML just draw pictures 
(primarily class and state diagrams), and do not generate code from these 
diagrams. Reasons for this include complexity, expense and inflexibility 
of tools.<p>

</p></li><li>Those programming in Object-Oriented languages tend to use many 
idioms and patterns that require boilerplate code. Examples include the 
code necessary for manipulating links of associations, the code to 
implement state machines, and the code for patterns such as Singleton. It 
would be better to build primitives for these into programming 
languages.<p>


</p></li></ul>

<h2>Some of our research questions</h2>

<ul>

<li>What proportion of software engineers use modelling languages and 
what for?<p>

</p></li><li>What are software engineers' reasons for using modelling languages, 
or not?<p>

</p></li><li>What features should we provide in a programming language like 
Umple?<p>

</p></li><li>If Umple was available to software engineeers, would they use it?<p>

</p></li><li>To what extent would textual-based modelling benefit software 
engineers?<p>

</p></li><li>Would users of different modelling languages such as BPEL and UML 
all benefit from a textual alternative?<p>

</p></li></ul>
